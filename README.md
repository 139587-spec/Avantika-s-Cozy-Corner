# Avantika's Cozy Corner 🌸

Welcome to my personal webpage! This is a small corner of the internet where I share the thing that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running. I built this page myself, and it has been such a fun jouney to see it come together!

## About Me 
Hi! I'm Avantika Satheesh. I love:
- 🧶 **Crochet** - I enjoy creating things stitch my stitch; it's relaxing and rewarding.
- 📚 **Reading** - Books take me to new worlds and give me fresh ideas.
- 🏃 **Running** - Running helps me clear my mind and stay energized.

## My Web Journey
I have never made a website before starting this project. I began with simple <html> and <css> 
code and learning how to structure content. Afterwards, I started experimenting with different 
styles and subtle animations. Seeing my page come alive in the browser is so rewarding!

## Why I Made This
I wanted to have a personal webpage that reflects on my hobbies adn my journey learning a little
bit of code. Although I do basics at school, it has been wonderful stringing all my ideas into 
one project!

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
I learned a lot about CSS animations and HTML while building this page. At first, figuring out how to center the header images and make them float smoothly was tricky, but experimenting and testing in the browser helped me understand it better. I also learned how to make a page responsive and how small design details can make a big difference in user experience. Afterwards, I started to use a little harder concepts to make my webpage aesthetically pleasing :)

## What You Can Do Here
Feel free to explore my hobbies and web journey! Each section of the site is structured like a personal journal, highlighting both what I love and the things I’ve learned along the way.

## Tech I Used 💻
Here's a peek at all the tools and code I used to bring my webpage to life:
- **HTML** - To structure all the sections and content.
- **CSS** - To style my page, add fonts, colors, borders, and some subtle animations.
- **GitHub Pages** - To host my webpage online so anyone can see it.
