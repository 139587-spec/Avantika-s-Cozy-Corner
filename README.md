# Avantika's Cozy Corner

Welcome to my personal webpage! This is a small corner of the internet where I share the thing that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running. I built this page myself, and it has been such a fun jouney to see it come together!

## About Me 
Hi! I'm Avantika Satheesh. I love:
- **Crochet** - I enjoy creating things stitch my stitch; it's relaxing and rewarding.
- **Reading** - Books take me to new worlds and give me fresh ideas.
- **Running** - Running helps me clear my mind and stay energized.

## My Web Journey
I have never made a website before starting this project. I began with simple <html> and <css> 
code and learning how to structure content. Afterwards, I started experimenting with different 
styles and subtle animations. Seeing my page come alive in the browser is so rewarding!
