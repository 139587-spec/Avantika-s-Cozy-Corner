Avantika's Cozy Corner 

Hiiii!! Welcome to my personal webpage!!! This a small little nook on the internet where I share silly hobbies of mine! I have always wanted to learn how to code and this project was soo fun to make. I truly learned soo much from this and hope to do more advanced projects in the future!

I lovee to crochet and have been doing it for around 2 years now. It is soo peaceful after a long day and I wanted this webpage to represent a calming part of me(dont worry...I am very chaotic too). I am also in cross country in school and enjoy running a lot! Lastly, I am probably the biggest book nerd you will ever meet! I love reading, mainly romance and fantasy books. They truly transport me to a crazy world everytime, and it is the perfect way to escape reality for even a few hours! I think that these 3 hobbies make a part of me and I wanted to represent what truly makes me happy.

My Journey - I have never made a website before starting this project! I I began with simple <html> and <css> code from school, but soon wanted to make the cooler ones that I see everyone else making. I started experimenting with different code, and figured out that I loved codeing! Every time I ran my project and it worked, I felt immense joy. I know my project is really basic(pls dont judgee:)))), but I hope to advance to Java and Python soon.

Why I Made This - Like I said before, I wanted something that represented me, which is why I used intimate parts of me to make this webpage come alive. I truly do love these hobbies and hope you love reading about my obsessions too:))

Lessons Learned - I learned lots of new tags, and to be honest they were quite overwhelming at first, but I soon got the hang of it. I found it astonishing on how many things you can do and the infinite amount of ways to improve projects. If you didn't know anything about me, one really important thing is that I love being asesthetic :)). I know it is corny, but I have a weird passion for aesthetically pleasing things. I think that is why when making this project, I worked very hard(maybe a little too hard) on making it look really good. I make hover details and background details which I think really brought it to life! 

What You Can Do Here - Feel free to explore my hobbies and web journey! It is basically like a diary entry, so do what you will with that :)). Hope you take something meaningful with you when you leave!!

Tech I Used - 
Here's a peek at all the tools and code I used to bring my webpage to life:
- **HTML** - To structure all the sections and content.
- **CSS** - To style my page, add fonts, colors, borders, and some subtle animations.
- **GitHub Pages** - To host my webpage online so anyone can see it.
