# Avantika's Cozy Corner 🌸

Welcome to my personal webpage! This is a small corner of the internet where I share the thing that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running. I built this page myself, and it has been such a fun jouney to see it come together!

## About Me 
Hi! I'm Avantika Satheesh. I love:
- 🧶 **Crochet** - I enjoy creating things stitch my stitch; it's relaxing and rewarding.
- 📚 **Reading** - Books take me to new worlds and give me fresh ideas.
- 🏃 **Running** - Running helps me clear my mind and stay energized.

## My Web Journey
I have never made a website before starting this project. I began with simple <html> and <css> 
code and learning how to structure content. Afterwards, I started experimenting with different 
styles and subtle animations. Seeing my page come alive in the browser is so rewarding!

## Why I Made This
I wanted to have a personal webpage that reflects on my hobbies adn my journey learning a little
bit of code. Although I do basics at school, it has been wonderful stringing all my ideas into 
one project!

## Tech I Used 💻
Here's a peek at all the tools and code I used to bring my webpage to life:
- **HTML** - To structure all the sections and content.
- **CSS** - To style my page, add fonts, colors, borders, and some subtle animations.
- **GitHub Pages** - To host my webpage online so anyone can see it.
