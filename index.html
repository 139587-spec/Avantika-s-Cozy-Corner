     <h2>Welcome to My Space 🌸</h2>
     <p>
      Hi, I'm Avantika! This webpage is my little cozy corner of the internet 
      about the things that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running.
      I've been learning how to design and build a page, and it has been so fun
	  to see it come alive in the browser!
     </p>

     <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>🧶 Crochet:</strong> Stitch by stitch, it helps me unwind and create something warm and wonderful.</li>
       <li><strong>📚 Reading:</strong> Books take me to new worlds and teach me something new every time.</li>
       <li><strong>🏃 Running:</strong> Running gives me energy and clears my mind - it's like a moving meditation.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>My Web Journey 🌐</h2>
     <p>
      Before this, I have never made a website!
      I had never made a website before, so starting with simple <code>&lt;html&gt</code> 
	  and <code>&lt;css&gt</code> was exciting. Each tag felt like a mini discovery, 
	  and seeing my page come to life was incredibly rewarding!
     </p>

    <section class="goal">
     <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
     <p>
      This project is my way of learning, creating, and sharing.
	  To me, it's proof that anyone can learn to code and express themselves online -
	  one small step (or one crochet loop!) at a time.

     <h2>My Reflection 💭</h2>
     <p>
      Building this page taught me that creativity and code go hand in hand. 
      Just like crochet pattern or a running route, a website has movement, flow, and design.
      I'm proud of what I've made and can't wait to create even more!
