  <h2>Welcome to My Space ðŸŒ¸</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Avantika! This little webpage is my tribute - A cozy corner of the internet 
    about the things that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running.
    Through this project, I've learned how to build and design my own webpage, 
    and I hope to inspire others to create theirs too!
