     <h2>Welcome to My Space 🌸</h2>
     <p>
      Hi, I'm Avantika! This little webpage is my tribute - A cozy corner of the internet 
      about the things that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running.
      Through this project, I've learned how to build and design my own webpage, 
      and I hope to inspire others to create theirs too!

     <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>🧶 Crochet:</strong> Stitch by stitch, it helps me unwind and create something warm and wonderful</li>
       <li><strong>📚 Reading:</strong> Books are my quiet escape - they take me to different worlds and teach me something new every time</li>
       <li><strong>🏃 Running:</strong> Running gives me energy and clears my mind - it's like a moving meditation.</li>

     <h2>My Web Journey 🌐</h2>
     <p>
      Before this, I have never made a website before!
      I started with simple <code>&lt;html&gt</code> and <code>&lt;css&gt</code> code, learning how to style and structure a page.
      Each tag felt like a new discovery, and seeing it come alive in the browser was so rewarding!

    <section class="goal">
     <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
     <p>
      I made this tribute as part of the Athena Award's "Tribute" project - a way to learn, create, and share. 
      To me, it's proof that anyone can learn to code and express themselves online, one small step (or one crochet loop!) at a time.

     <h2>My Reflection 💭</h2>
     <p>
      Building this page taught me that creativity and code go hand in hand. 
      Just like crochet pattern or a running route, a website has movement, flow, and design.
      I'm proud of what I've made and can't wait to build even more!
