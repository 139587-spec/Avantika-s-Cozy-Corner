     <h2>Welcome to My Space 🌸</h2>
     <p>
      Hi, I'm Avantika! This webpage is my little cozy corner of the internet 
      about the things that make me the happiest: books, crochet, and running.
      <br>
      I've been learning how to design and build a page, and it has been so fun
	  to see it come alive in the browser!
     </p>

     <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>🧶 Crochet:</strong> Stitch by stitch, it helps me unwind and create something warm and wonderful.</li>
       <li><strong>📚 Reading:</strong> Books take me to new worlds and teach me something new every time.</li>
       <li><strong>🏃 Running:</strong> Running gives me energy and clears my mind(even tho sometimes I feel like dying)</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>My Web Journey 🌐</h2>
     <p>
      Before this, I have never made a website, so starting with simple 
      <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. Each tag felt like a mini discovery, 
	  and seeing my page come to life was incredibly rewarding!
     </p>
    </section>

    <section class="goal">
     <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
     <p>
      This project is my way of expressing myself through my hobbies. I think If 
      I could make a prject after no prior knowledge, it will hopefully inspire
      others to do the same and unleash their creativity!

     <h2>My Reflection 💭</h2>
     <p>
      Building this page taught me that creativity and code go hand in hand. There
      are just so many ways to make your page unique and personal, and I have loved 
      the process of learing them!(although it was a veryyy long process)
      I'm proud of what I've made and can't wait to create even more!
